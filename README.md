# Introduction
An Expense Minimizer is an algorithmic approach designed to optimize the settlement of shared expenses among a group, aiming to minimize the total amount of money exchanged. The goal is to streamline the settlement process by reducing both the number of transactions and the overall financial exchange required. This method helps simplify the repayment process and ensures that the group can efficiently balance expenses with fewer transactions and minimized cash flow.

# How the Expense Minimizer Works
The Expense Minimizer algorithm processes all shared transactions within a group and calculates each person's net balance. Based on this, individuals are categorized into two groups:

Creditors (net balance > 0): They are owed money.
Debtors (net balance < 0): They owe money.
Individuals with a net balance of zero are considered settled. The algorithm starts by pairing the largest debtor with the largest creditor and settling their amounts. This continues iteratively, reducing the number of transactions, until all debts are resolved.

A Max Heap can be used to efficiently manage the largest creditors and debtors during the process, ensuring the most significant debts are settled first, leading to fewer total transactions.
