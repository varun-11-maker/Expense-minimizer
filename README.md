# Introduction
An Expense Minimizer is an algorithmic approach designed to optimize the settlement of shared expenses among a group, aiming to minimize the total amount of money exchanged. The goal is to streamline the settlement process by reducing both the number of transactions and the overall financial exchange required. This method helps simplify the repayment process and ensures that the group can efficiently balance expenses with fewer transactions and minimized cash flow.
